# investmentFundCalculation
Demo for investment fund calculation

Project is created as java application based on 
- spring boot,
- h2 memory database,
- Swagger2 as ui for testing REST services

to test application :

```sh
git clone https://github.com/robertstrojny/investmentFundCalculation.git
```

to build application :

```sh
mvn clean install
```

to run application :

```sh
mvn spring-boot:run
```
To do tests from documentation go to swagger ui :

```sh 
http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
```

There are two services: 
- fund-rest-service-impl
- fund-rest-service-impl
to run it with swagger click `Try in out`, prepare input parameters if needed and click `execute`

fund-rest-service-impl is for getting information about declared investment funds
It returns list off funds:

```

    "id": 1,
    "name": "Fundusz Polski 1",
    "type": "POLISH"
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Fundusz Polski 2",
    "type": "POLISH"
